# texereau

This repository contains a cleaned-up version of the "tex" program
that was originally written by Michael Lindner and Larry Phillips.
This program is almost exclusively their work.  I've placed it on
github.com so that it can be accessed and recompiled as needed for 
new platforms.  I'm particularly interested in keeping it available
for Linux/FreeBSD, which are my operating system of choice.  It should
run just fine on the smallest computers like the Raspberry Pi.

I originally fetched this source code from 
[Stellafane's page of Foucault Data Reduction Software](https://stellafane.org/tm/atm/test/software.html "Foucault Data Reduction Software"). If you are interested in finding pre-compiled binaries for DOS/Windows, Mac OS X and Linux, you can go there.
